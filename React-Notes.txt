JavaScript refresher
    let & const
        let & const are simply replacement of var
        let - can have more than 1 assignment
        const - can have at most one assignment. Otherwise error will be thrown. Good way to make sure, value is not changed anywhere.

    export & import
        2 types named and unnamed exports
            default(named) => export default ...;
            named => export const someData = ...;
        importing named export - Should be wrapped inside {}
            import { nameOfExport } from './path/to/file'
                    or
            import * as bundled from './path/to/file'
            bundled.<nameOfExport>
        importing unnamed(default) export - Doesn't need {}
            import anyName from './path/to/file'
        A file can have only one default export and any number of named exports
    Spread & Rest operator
        ... means spread or Rest operator based on where it is used
        If used in array spreads array into individual elements of array
            const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
            const newArray = [...oldArray, 4, 5];

            const oldObject = {
            name: 'Max'
            };
            const newObject = {
            ...oldObject,
            age: 28
            };
        If used in method parameter, it compressses all parameters into an 
            function restExample(...restParam){
                restParam[0]+restParam[1];
            }
            restExample(2,3);
    Destructuring
        Allows to pick specific elements of array or properties of a object
            const [a,,b] = [1,2,3];
            console.log(a,b);//prints 1 3
            const [c,d] = [1,2,3];            
            console.log(c,d);//prints 1 2

            let person = {name:Ragul, Age:34};
            let [name] = person;
            console.log(name);//prints Ragul
    Array functions
        Set of functions we can perform on each element of an array
